       <p>Hello my name is Arvid Johnsen. I was born in the Philippines but raised in Jersey City,NJ. I am a graduate of Christ Hospital School of Nursing and worked as a RN in Christ hospital for a year before deciding to switch careers. 
       I am currently enrolled in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and hope to graduate in 6 months.Hobbies include playing tennis, boxing, and relearning how to play piano. I have always found programming an enigma, and considered it to be black magic as far as I was concerned. Now that I have dabbled with it a bit, I see that it is very similar to learning any other foreign language but combined with very strict logic and grammar but that's because instead of communicating to a person we are communicating to a computer. I have always enjoyed thinking about problems and trying to solve and finally having that "aha" moment when you figure it out. I feel that learning programming is a constant process of discovery with many "aha" moments that. It also is a very powerful tool that solves so many different types of problems, and I am very excited to learn.</p>
